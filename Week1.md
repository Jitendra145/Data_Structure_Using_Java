# Mathematics
**Prime No:** A prime number is a whole number greater than 1 whose only factors are 1 and itself.
The first few prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23 and 29. Numbers that have more than two factors are called composite numbers. The number 1 is neither prime nor composite. 
For example, suppose n is a whole number, and it is not yet known if n is prime or composite. First, take the square root (or the 1/2 power) of n; then round this number up to the next highest whole number and call the result m.  Then find all of the following quotients:

qm = n / m
q(m-1) = n / (m-1)
q(m-2) = n / (m-2)
q(m-3) = n / (m-3)
. . .
q3 = n / 3
q2 = n / 2

The number n is prime if -- and only if -- none of the q's, as derived above, are whole numbers.

**GCD:** In mathematics, the greatest common divisor (gcd) of two or more integers, which are not all zero, is the largest positive integer that divides each of the integers. For example, the gcd of 8 and 12 is 4.
