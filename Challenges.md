# Udemy introduction-to-data-structures-algorithms-in-java Questions

## linked List
1. Append the last n nodes of a linked list to the beginning of the list. Will keeping the length as a member variable inside the LinkedList class, help?
2. Write a 'reverse' method in the LinkedList class, which reverses the order of the elements of the list.
3. Write a method to find kth element from a singly linked List from the end(not from the head) in one pass.
4. Write an algorithm to remove duplicates from an unsorted linked list. What is the time complexity? (You can use the Set provided in the JDK). How will you solve it if additional memory is not allowed?
5. Implement an algorithm to delete a node from somewhere in the middle of a SINGLY linked list, given that you have access only to this node (and of course the subsequent nodes).
    E.g.
    INPUT: The node 'v' from the linked list u->v->w->x->y->z
    RESULT: The new list should look like this u->w->x->y->z
6. How can you identify if a Linked List is circular? (Think about using two pointers/references)
